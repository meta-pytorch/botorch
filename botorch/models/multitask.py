    Multi-task exact GP that uses a simple ICM kernel. Can be single-output or
    multi-output. This model uses relatively strong priors on the base Kernel
    hyperparameters, which work best when covariates are normalized to the unit
    cube and outcomes are standardized (zero mean, unit variance).

    This model infers the noise level. WARNING: It currently does not support
    different noise levels for the different tasks. If you have known observation
    noise, please use `FixedNoiseMultiTaskGP` instead.
