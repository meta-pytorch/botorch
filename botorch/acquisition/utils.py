    Args:
        acquisition_function_name: Name of the acquisition function.
        model: A fitted model.
        X_observed: A `q' x d`-dim Tensor of `q'`` design points that have
            already been observed and would be considered as the best design
            point.
        objective: A callable mapping a Tensor of size `b x q x t` to a Tensor
            of size `b x q`, where `t` is the number of outputs of the model.
            This callable must support broadcasting. If omitted, squeeze the
            output dimension (applicable to single- output models only).
        constraints: A list of callables, each mapping a Tensor of size
            `b x q x t` to a Tensor of size `b x q`, where negative values
            imply feasibility. Note: the callable must support broadcasting.
            Only relevant for multi-output models (`t` > 1).
        infeasible_cost: The infeasibility cost `M`. Should be set s.t.
            `-M < min_x obj(x)`.
        X_pending: A `m x d`-dim Tensor with `m` design points that are
            pending for evaluation.
        seed: If provided, perform deterministic optimization (i.e. the
            function to optimize is fixed and not stochastic).
        qmc: If True, use quasi-Monte-Carlo sampling (instead of iid).
        acquisition_function_args: A map containing extra arguments for
            initializing the acquisition function module. E.g. for q-UCB, this
            can be used to specify the `beta` parameter.
