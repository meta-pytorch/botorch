title: Using botorch with Ax
---

[Ax](https://github.com/facebook/Ax) is a platform for sequential
experimentation.
It relies on botorch for implementing Bayesian Optimization algorithms, but
provides higher-level APIs that make it easy and convenient to specify
problems, visualize results, and benchmark new algorithms. It also comes with powerful metadata management, storage of results, and deployment-related APIs. Ax makes it convenient to
use botorch in most standard Bayesian Optimization settings. Simply put, if
botorch is the "un-framework", then Ax is the "framework".

Ax provides a `BotorchModel` (**TODO**: cross-link to Ax documentation) that is a sensible default for modeling and
optimization which can be customized by specifying and passing in
bespoke model constructors, acquisition functions, and optimization strategies.
This model bridge utilizes a number of built-in transformations (**TODO**: make sure these transformations are documented in Ax, and link to them here), such normalizing input spaces and outputs to ensure reasonable fitting of GPs.

## When to use botorch though Ax

If it's simple to use botorch through Ax for your problem, then
use Ax.  It dramatically reduces the amount of bookkeeping one needs to do as a Bayesian optimization researcher, such as keeping track of results, and transforming inputs and outputs to ranges that will ensure sensible handling in (G)PyTorch. The functionality provided by Ax should apply to most standard use cases.

For instance, say you want to experiment with using a different kind of surrogate model, or a new type of acquisition function, but leave the rest of the the Bayesian
Optimization loop untouched. It is then straightforward to plug your custom botorch
model or acquisition function into Ax to take advantage of Ax's various loop control APIs,
as well as its powerful automated metadata management, data storage, etc. See the
[Using a custom botorch model in Ax](../tutorials/custom_botorch_model_in_ax)
tutorial for more on how ot do this.

## When not to use Ax

If you're working in a non-standard setting, such as those with high-dimensional or structured feature or design spaces, or where the model fitting process requires interactive work, then using Ax may not be the best solution for you. In such
a situation, you might be better off writing your own full Bayesian Optimization
loop outside of Ax. The
[q-Noisy Constrained EI](../tutorials/closed_loop_botorch_only) tutorial and
[variational auto-encoder](../tutorials/vae_mnist) tutorial give examples of how
this can be done.
