An `Objective` is a `Module` that allows for convenient transformation of model outputs.
Typical use cases for this are scalarization of outputs for a multi-output model (see
e.g. [^RandScal]), or optimization subject to outcome constraints, which can be
achieved by weighting the objective by the probability of feasibility [^NoisyEI].

When using classical analytic formulations of acquisition functions, one needs
to be careful that the transformation results in a posterior distribution of the transformed outputs that still satisfies the assumptions of the analytic formulation. For instance, to use standard Expected Improvement on a transformed output of a
model, the transformation needs to be affine (because Gaussians are closed under affine transformations).

When using MC-based acquisition functions, however, fewer assumptions
are required, and one can apply general transformations to the model outputs
with relative impunity so long gradients can be back-propagated through the transformation. botorch implements several MC-based objectives, including `LinearMCObjective` for linear combinations of objectives, and `ConstrainedMCObjective` for constrained objectives (via softmax).
