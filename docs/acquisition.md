## Monte Carlo (MC) evaluation of q-batch acquisition functions

Many common acquisition functions can be expressed as the expectation of some
real-valued function of the model output(s) at the design point(s):

$$ H(X) = \mathbb{E}\bigl[ h(Y) \mid Y \sim \mathbb{P}_Y(X) \bigr] $$

Here $\mathbb{P}_Y(X)$ is the posterior distribution of $Y$ given $X$.

Evaluating the acquisition function thus requires evaluating an integral over
the posterior distribution. In most cases, this is analytically intractable (in
particular, analytic expressions do generally not exist for `q > 1`).

An alternative is to use Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling to approximate the integrals.
A MC approximation of $H$ at $X$ using $N$ MC samples is

$$ H(X) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N h(y_j) $$

where $y_j \sim \mathbb{P}_Y(X)$.


botorch relies on the re-parameterization trick and MC sampling for
optimization and estimation of the batch acquisition functions [^Wilson2017].

- The re-parameterization trick (see e.g. [^KingmaWelling2014], [^Rezende2014])
can be used to write the posterior distribution as a deterministic
transformation of an auxiliary random variable $\epsilon$. For example, a
normally distributed random variable $X$ with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation
$\theta$ has the same distribution as $\mu + \sigma \epsilon$ where $\epsilon$
is a standard normal. Therefore, an expectation with respect to $X$ can be
approximated using samples from $\epsilon$. In the case where $\mu$ and $\sigma$
are parameters of an optimization problem, MC approximations of the objective at
different values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ can be computed using a single set of
"base samples."

- What are the trade-offs between using a fixed set of base samples versus
re-sampling on every MC evaluation of the acquisition function? If the base
samples are fixed, the problem of optimizing the acquisition function becomes
deterministic, allowing for conventional quasi-second order methods to be used
(e.g., `L-BFGS` and Sequential Least-Squares Programming). These have faster
convergence rates than first-order methods and can speed up acquisition function
optimization significantly. Although the approximated acquisition function is
biased in this case, our anecdotal observations suggest that the location of
optimizer itself does not change much. On the other hand, if re-sampling is used,
the optimization objective becomes stochastic (though unbiased) and a stochastic
optimizer should be used.

- Base samples are constructed using an `MCSampler` object, which provides an
interface that allows for different sampling techniques. `IIDNormalSampler`
utilizes independent standard normal draws, while `SobolQMCNormalSampler` uses
quasi-random, low-discrepancy "Sobol" sequences as uniform samples which are
then transformed to construct normal samples. Sobol sequences are more evenly distributed than i.i.d. uniform samples and tend to
improve the convergence rate of MC estimates of integrals/expectations.
We find that Sobol sequences substantially improve the performance of MC-based acquisition
functions, and so `SobolQMCNormalSampler` is used by default.

## Analytic Acquisition Functions

`botorch` also provides implementation of analytic acquisition functions that
do not depend on MC sampling. These acquisition functions are subclasses of
`AnalyticAcquisitionFunction` and only exist for the case of `q = 1`. These
include classical acquisition functions such as Expected Improvement (EI),
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and Probability of Improvement (PI). An example
comparing the analytic version of EI `ExpectedImprovement` to the MC version
`qExpectedImprovement` can be found in [LINK TO ACQUISITION TUTORIAL].

Analytic acquisition functions allow for an explicit expression in terms of the
summary statistics of the posterior distribution at the evaluated point(s).
A classic such acquisition function is Expected Improvement of a single point
for a Gaussian posterior, given by

$$ \text{EI}(x) = \mathbb{E}\bigl[
\max(y - f_{max}, 0) \mid y\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu(x), \sigma^2(x))
\bigr] $$

where $\mu(x)$ and $\sigma(x)$ are the posterior mean and variance of $f$ at the
point $x$, and $f_{max}$ is the best function value observed so far (assuming
noiseless observations). It can be shown that

$$ \text{EI}(x) = \sigma(x) \bigl( z \Phi(z) + \varphi(z) \bigr)$$

where $z = \frac{\mu(x) - f_{\max}}{\sigma(x)}$ and $\Phi$ and $\varphi$ are
the cdf and pdf of the standard Normal distribution, respectively.

With some additional work, it is also possible to express the gradient of
the Expected Improvement with respect to the design $x$. Classic Bayesian
Optimization software will implement this gradient function explicitly, so that
it can be used for numerically optimizing the acquisition function.

botorch, in contrast, harnesses PyTorch's automatic differentiation feature
("autograd") in order to obtain gradients of acquisition functions. This makes
implementing new acquisition functions much less cumbersome, as it does not
require to analytically derive gradients. All that is required is that the
operations performed in the acquisition function computation allow for the
back-propagation of gradient information through the posterior and the model.
