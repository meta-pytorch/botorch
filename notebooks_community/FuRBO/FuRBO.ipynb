    "# Feasibility-driven trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contributors: paoloascia, elenaraponi\n",
    "- Last update 04 December 2025\n",
    "- BoTorch version: 0.12.0\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how to implement the Feasibility-driven trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) [1] algorithm in a closed loop, with restarts. This is a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm developed specifically to handle severely constrained problems, while still performing well in simpler settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature of FuRBO is the new definition of the trust region. At each iteration, we define the trust regions as a hyper-rectangle encapsulating subregions of the search space predicted to be promising by the Gaussian process regression (GPR) models of the objective and constraints. Compared to other trust-region-based methods, such as Scalable Constrained Bayesian Optimization (SCBO) [2], FuRBO offers higher flexibility in how the trust region evolves. Its position and shape adapt dynamically to the regions predicted to be both feasible and optimal, allowing the search to align with the structure of the GP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of mildly constrained scenarios, the new definition of the trust region is advantageous when several samples are evaluated at each iteration (batches). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we recommend using FuRBO when solving:\n",
    "  - high-dimensional constrained black-box problems;\n",
    "  - severely constrained black-box problems of any dimension D;\n",
    "  - constrained problems evaluated with large batch sizes (i.e., bigger than 1D).\n",

    "Tho show the implementation of FuRBO, we use a 20D Ackley function on the domain $[−5,10]^{10}$ subject to two constraint functions $c_1$ and $c_2$. The problem maximizes the Ackley function under the constraints $c_1(x) \\leq 0$ and $c_2(x) \\leq 0$. The Ackley function is translated in every dimension, so that the optimum of the unconstrained problem lies outside of the feasible area. Since this problem presents only two constraints, we showcase the performance with a batch of $q = 3D = 30$."

    "This definition yields two main properties:\n",
    "1. The trust region can jump across the entire domain since it is defined based on the posterior of the GPR models instead of the current best evaluated sample, as SCBO[2] or TuRBO[3].\n",
    "2. The trust region shape adapts to the most promising area according to the GPR models of objective and constraints, e.g., if the promising area is narrow and long, the trust region will also be narrow and long.  \n",
