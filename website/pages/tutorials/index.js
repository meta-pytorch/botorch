                The tutorials here will help you understand and use BoTorch in
                your own work. They assume that you are familiar with both
                Bayesian optimization and PyTorch.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are new to Bayesian optimization, we recommend you start
                with the <a href="https://ax.dev/docs/bayesopt">Ax docs</a> and
                the following{' '}
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811">tutorial paper</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are new to PyTorch, the easiest way to get started is
                with the{' '}
                <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-tensor-tutorial-py">
                  What is PyTorch?
                </a>{' '}
                tutorial.
              </p>
              <p>
                The BoTorch tutorials are grouped into the following four areas:
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4>Using BoTorch with Ax</h4>
                These tutorials give you an overview of how to leverage{' '}
                <a href="https://ax.dev">Ax</a>, a platform for sequential
                experimentation, in order to simplify managing your Bayesian
                Optimization (BO) loop. Doing so can help you focus on the main
                BO components (Models, Acqusition functions, Optimization of
                Acquisition functions), rather than tedious loop control. See
                our{' '}
                <a href="https://botorch.org/docs/botorch_and_ax">
                  Documentation
                </a>{' '}
                for additional information.
                <h4>Full Optimization Loops</h4>
                In some situations (e.g. if you're working in a non-standard
                setting, or simply if you want to be able to understand and
                control every single aspect of your BO loop), then you may also
                consider working purely in BoTorch. The tutorials in this
                section show you how to do that.
                <h4>Bite-Sized Tutorials</h4>
                Rather than guiding you thorugh full end-to-end Bayesian
                Optimization loops, the tutorials in this section focus on
                specific tasks that you will encounter in customizing your BO
                algorithms. For instance, you may want to{' '}
                <a href="https://botorch.org/tutorials/custom_acquisition">
                  write a custom acquisition function
                </a>
                , and{' '}
                <a href="https://botorch.org/tutorials/optimize_with_cmaes">
                  use a custom zero-th order optimizer
                </a>{' '}
                for optimizing it.
                <h4>Advanced Usage</h4>
                Tutorials in this section showcase more advanced ways of using
                BoTorch. For instance, the{' '}
                <a href="https://botorch.org/tutorials/vae_mnist">this</a>{' '}
                tutorial shows how to perform BO if your objective function is
                an image, by optimizing in the latent space of a ariational
                auto-encoder (VAE).
