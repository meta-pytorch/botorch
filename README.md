botorch is a library for Bayesian Optimization in PyTorch.

It is currently an alpha version under active development - expect things to break!


## Installation

**Requirements**:
- Python >= 3.6
- PyTorch >= 1.0.1
- gpytorch >= 0.2.1
- cython (to be removed with PyTorch 1.1 release)
- scipy


#### Install into a clean conda environment

1. Create the base environment using `conda env create -f botorch_base.yml`

2. Activate the environment using `conda activate botorch_base`

3. Install via pip:
  - current master: `pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/facebookexternal/botorch.git`
  - local checkout:
    1. `git clone git@github.com:facebookexternal/botorch.git`
    2. `pip install -e .`


*Notes:*
- In 3. you **must** use ssh since the repo is private - for that to work, make
  sure your ssh public key is registered with GitHub, and is usable by ssh.
- You will want to have PyTorch link against MKL. This can be kind of finicky,
  to make sure this works use the conda install (see the quick start
  instructions on https://pytorch.org/)
- To use **CUDA on MacOS**, pytorch needs to be built from source instead
  (also the quick start instructions)
